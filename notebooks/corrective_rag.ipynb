    "##### Overview :\n",
    "    The Corrective RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) process is an advanced information retrieval and response generation system. It extends the standard RAG approach by dynamically evaluating and correcting the retrieval process, combining the power of vector databases, web search, and language models to provide accurate and context-aware responses to user queries."

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### Motivation\n",
    "    While traditional RAG systems have improved information retrieval and response generation, they can still fall short when the retrieved information is irrelevant or outdated. The Corrective RAG process addresses these limitations by:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Leveraging pre-existing knowledge bases\n",
    "    2. Evaluating the relevance of retrieved information\n",
    "    3. Dynamically searching the web when necessary\n",
    "    4. Refining and combining knowledge from multiple sources\n",
    "    5. Generating human-like responses based on the most appropriate knowledge"

  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### Key Components\n",
    "    1. FAISS Index: A vector database for efficient similarity search of pre-existing knowledge.\n",
    "    2. Retrieval Evaluator: Assesses the relevance of retrieved documents to the query.\n",
    "    3. Knowledge Refinement: Extracts key information from documents when necessary.\n",
    "    4. Web Search Query Rewriter: Optimizes queries for web searches when local knowledge is   insufficient.\n",
    "    5. Response Generator: Creates human-like responses based on the accumulated knowledge."
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "##### Method Details\n",
    "    1. Document Retrieval:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. Performs similarity search in the FAISS index to find relevant documents.\n",
    "        b. Retrieves top-k documents (default k=3).\n",
    "    2. Document Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. Calculates relevance scores for each retrieved document.\n",
    "        b. Determines the best course of action based on the highest relevance score.\n",
    "    3. Corrective Knowledge Acquisition:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. If high relevance (score > 0.7): Uses the most relevant document as-is.\n",
    "        b. If low relevance (score < 0.3): Corrects by performing a web search with a rewritten query.\n",
    "        c. If ambiguous (0.3 ≤ score ≤ 0.7): Corrects by combining the most relevant document with web search results.\n",
    "    4. Adaptive Knowledge Processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. For web search results: Refines the knowledge to extract key points.\n",
    "        b. For ambiguous cases: Combines raw document content with refined web search results.\n",
    "    5. Response Generation:\n",
    "\n",
    "        a. Uses a language model to generate a human-like response based on the query and acquired knowledge.\n",
    "        b. Includes source information in the response for transparency."

    "    1. Dynamic Correction: Adapts to the quality of retrieved information, ensuring relevance and accuracy.\n",
    "    2. Flexibility: Leverages both pre-existing knowledge and web search as needed.\n",
    "    3. Accuracy: Evaluates the relevance of information before using it, ensuring high-quality responses.\n",
    "    4. Transparency: Provides source information, allowing users to verify the origin of the information.\n",
    "    5. Efficiency: Uses vector search for quick retrieval from large knowledge bases.\n",
    "    6. Contextual Understanding: Combines multiple sources of information when necessary to provide comprehensive responses.\n",
    "    7. Up-to-date Information: Can supplement or replace outdated local knowledge with current web information."

      "Answer: Harry beat Quirrell by physically touching him, which caused Quirrell to burn and resulting in a loss of his physical strength. This allowed Harry to break the chokehold that Quirrell had on him and ultimately retrieve the Philosopher's Stone. Harry's physical touch also seemed to have a magical effect, as Quirrell disintegrated into ash and dust after being touched by Harry.\n",
